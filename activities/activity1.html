		<h1>Activity 1</h1>
		<h2>Set up</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Download workshop materials <a href="https://github.com/emeljay/ghc/archive/master.zip">here</a>, if you haven't already.</li>
			<li>Open the workshop materials folder and navigate to the <i>website/</i> directory.</li>
			<li>Open index.html in Chrome. NOTE: If you already feel comfortable using a screen reader on your machine, open index_no_screenreader.html instead.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the "Heading" button on the screen reader to jump to all the heads in the app. Are you able to use this button to jump to the very first site title heading on the page?</li>
			<li>Try using the keyboard (tab and enter key) to buy an item.</li>
			<li>Click the first "buy" button using the mouse. You'll notice a dialog appear. Without looking at the screen, did you receive any indication from the screen reader that a dialog popped up? Do you know what the dialog is for?</li>
			<li>Using the keyboard, try to tab to the first input field in the dialog.</li>
			<li>Once you've tabbed to the input fields in the dialog, try filling out the fields. Looking at the screen, you can determine that the input fields are for quantity, name, and email. Without looking at the screen, can you figure out what each input field is for?</li>
			<li>Try navigating to the "X" button on the dialog.</li>
			<li>Try selecting the "submit" button.</li>
