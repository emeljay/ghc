		<h1>Exerercise 1: Headers</h1>
		<div>
			Use the "heading" at the bottom of the website to navigate all of the headers on the page. Notice that this allows you to navigate most of the headings on the site, except for the site title. 
		</div>
		
		<div>
			Text on a page must be identified as a header for a screen reader to recognize it. In the HTML file (index.html), you'll notice that most header text is wrapped in a header tag (h1, h2, h3, etc). Try adding the appropriate HTML markup so that the site title is navigable using the "heading" button. This markup allows users who use a screen reader to distinguish between different types of text (body text vs headers).
		</div>
		<div>
			 Aria roles may be used in place of heading tags to achieve the same effect. For example:

			<div class="code">
				&lt;div aria-role="heading" aria-level="3"&gt;
				<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a header
				<br/>
				&lt;/div&gt;
				<br/><br/>-- Or equivantly --<br/><br/>
				&lt;h3&gt;
				<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a header
				<br/>
				&lt;/h3&gt;
			</div>
		</div>

		<div>
			When possible, W3C recommends using native markup (h1, h2, etc) rather than using aria-roles (which we'll learn more about later). In practice, aria-roles might be necessary, especially when building accessibility for a legacy website.
		</div>



		<h1>Exercise 2: Tab indices</h1>
		<div>
			The tabindex HTML attribute defines the navigation order for focusable elements. This attribute can also give elements which are normally focusable the ability to gain focus, or remove that ability from normally focusable elements. Elements such as "div" or "span" are not focusable by default (since they are typically text nodes, and need not be interacted with by mouse or keyboard). Specifying a tabindex value for these elements allows them to gain focus when navigating with the keyboard.
		</div>

		<div>
			Possible values for the tabindex attribute are:
			
			<ul>
			<li><div class="code inline">tabindex="1"</div><br/>A positive value for the tabindex defines an explicit navigation order, and makes the element focusable if it is not already.</li><br/>
			<li><div class="code inline">tabindex="0"</div><br/>A tabindex value of 0 does not change the natural navigation order of an element, but makes it focusable if it is not already.</li><br/>
			<li><div class="code inline">tabindex="-1"</div><br/>A tabindex value of -1 makes an element unable to gain focus using the "tab" key. However, the element can still receive focus programatically, using javascript.</li><br/>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			By default, the navigation order for elements on a page is left-to-right and top-to-bottom. A positive tabindex value allows the natural ordering to be modified. This is not recommended, especially for HTML pages with focusable elements (like buttons or input fields), since it results in unexpected jumps in focus. Imagine if hitting tab caused focus to jump from the start of the page to an element at the very bottom of the page. Instead of manually changing the natural ordering, the actual HTML structure of the page should modified to produce the desired navigation order. 
		</div>
			
		<div>
			Try using the 'tab' key to navigate the demo page. You'll notice that one of the items on the page cannot be focused. Use the information about tab indicies above to fix this issue.
		</div>



		<h1>Exercise 3: Native elements</h1>
		<div>
			Try using the tab key to navigate to the "BUY" buttons. You'll notice that these buttons cannot gain focus. If you hover over one of these buttons with the mouse, you'll also notice that the cursor doesn't change to the "hand" cursor, which is typical of buttons. These buttons do not work as expected because they are actually "div" elements styled to look like buttons in CSS.
		</div>
		<div>
			To fix this, it's possible to use tabindicies to make the buttons focusable and CSS to make the correct cursor appear on hover. However, this is not recommended. As we learned in Exercise 1, the preferred solution is to use native elements -- which have the correct behavior by default.
		</div>
		
		<div>
			Try changing the buttons on this website from "div" elements to "button" elements. This includes the submitButton, dialogCloseButton, and all buyButton elements. Test to see if this worked by using the "tab" key to navigate all buttons. 
		</div>


		<h1>Exercise 4: Color contrast</h1>

		<div>
			Even though we've fixed the functionality of the buttons, they're still not quite fully accessible due to their low color contrast. The gray text (#808080) is difficult to discern from the blue (#0000FF) background. To learn more, go to the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a> and check that out. Try different color combinations and modify the color or background-color attributes on the buttons to get a better color contrast ratio!
			<blockquote>
				WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

				Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger.

		<div>
			Don't be afraid to push back on designs that use colors that have color contrast ratios that are too low!

		<h1>Exercise 5: Aria-roles</h1>
		<div>
			In the first exercise, we introduced the aria-role attribute. There are dozens of different aria-roles, like the one we looked at above for headings. These roles define an element's type for a screen reader. Roles are attached to elements and must not be modified over time. There are aria-roles for menus, autocompletes, lists, dialogs, grids, tooltips, etc.
		</div>
		
		<div>
			Let's take a closer look at the "list" aria-role.
		</div>

		<div>
			TODO!!
		</div>

		<h1>Exercise 6: Dialogs</h1>
		<div>
			Using a screen reader, navigate to the "buy" dialog and tab through the various input fields inside the dialog. You'll notice a few issues with navigating the dialog using the screen reader, such as:
		
			<ol>
				<li>There is no indication or announcement by the screen reader when the dialog opens.</li>
				<li>Focus is mismanaged. Once the dialog opens, focus is still unexpectedly in the background of the page.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			To fix this, the dialog must have correct labels and keyboard focus must be properly handled. Let's start by learning how to add proper labels to the dialog. First, a dialog must have the role="dialog" attribute. For sighted users, the dialog is labelled by its title. For screen readers to also be able to associate the dialog with its title, 

			TODO!!! (follow steps here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_dialog_role)

			draft/notes:
			You'll notice that focus is still unexpectedly in the background of the page, rather than inside this dialog. To fix this, we're going to need to 1) make the dialog focusable and 2) use javascript to draw focus to the dialog, and then restore focus to the main page after the dialog has been closed. 

			Try adding the tabindex attribute to the "buyDialog" to make it focusable using javascript. In javascript, modify the showDialog function so that the dialog receives focus when it is shown.

			If time permits at the end of this workshop, try adding javascript to restore focus to the last focused element on the mainPage once the dialog closes. Hint: You'll have to keep track of the currently focused element when the dialog pops up and make modifications to the hideDialog function to restore focus.


			Marking a dialog with this aria role allows assistive technologies to identify and differentiate content inside the dialog from the rest of the page.
